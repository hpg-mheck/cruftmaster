# Analog
# ------
# This class is a mixin that provides a drive or media type with utility
# methods appropriate for analog storage.  Using them on a per-device-type
# (and, potentially, per-model) basis ensures that a fault will be triggered
# if an inappropriate technique is used on storage where it makes no sense.
