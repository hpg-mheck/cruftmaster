cruftmaster
===========

Do you have a pile of old recordable CDs, DVDs, or Blu-Ray discs?
They're all in cases, right?  Sealed?  In climate-controlled storage?
Not so much?
Oh dear.

While a 2007 report from the National Institute of Stanadards and Technology, prepared primarily for
the Library of Congress, showed that some discs were predicted to have lifespans up to 40 years, they
found that others might fail in 10-15 years.

And, all of those discs have one thing in common: they assumed people were storing them a lot better
than you probably are.  Specifically, in jewel cases, on shelves, in buildings with constant humidity
and temperature.

If you've got a binder full of optical media sitting in your garage, or a nice hot storage unit that
gets wet when it rains, I hate to break it to you, but you're not looking at 40 year media life.
You're looking at more like 7-10 year media life, and you need to start transferring that stuff right
now-- and not all of those transfers are going to work.

That's right-- what would have been a technical debt problem a few years earlier, has now turned into
a data recovery problem.  Oh, heavens.  What to do?

Well, as it happens, solutions exist.  The problem is that they tend to come in two flavors: very
comprehensive, but very expensive, commercial forensic recovery software, suitable for law enforcement
usage with minimal training, and "open source" utilities, which are free to use, but quite arcane.
These can do the same job as much of the commercial software-- sometimes more-- but you need to get
familiar with about forty of them.

Meanwhile, if you do spring for the commercial stuff, you may find it doesn't fit your workflow very
well.  Having to clear the big pile of CDs off the kitchen table because it's time for dinner isn't
something that comes up in an enterprise setting-- it feels ridiculous, and it's frustrating.  But it
totally happens, and you need a workflow that can deal wih it.

The cruftmaster project is designed to provide a set of utilities that can make working with all these
different command-line utilities easier.  It aims to provide a consistent way to rapidly archive
optical discs in a sensible way, and to allow for a rapid first pass, followed by deeper work at a
later date.

It is designed, first and foremost, to kill excuses for not archiving old media-- because the longer
you wait, the less you're going to get back off of it.

Watch this space!  Changes will be rapid and frequent.  A call for contributors will happen around
March 15th, 2019.
