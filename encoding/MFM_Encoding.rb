# MFM
# ---
# Modified Frequency Modulation, a run-length limited (RLL) coding scheme for
# encoding data on hard disks and floppy diskettes.
#
# With respect to hard disk drives specifcally, "MFM controllers" pre-date
# the higher-density "RLL controllers", though strictly speaking, they all
# use run-length limited encoding schemes.  For details, please see:
