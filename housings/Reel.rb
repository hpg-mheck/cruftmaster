# Reel
# ----
# This is a base class for any storage media consisting of magnetic,
# optical, or punched tape, film, or wire, wound onto a cylindrical reel.
#
# While single-reel, "endless loop" systems do exist (perhaps most notably,
# "8-Track" tapes), the more common form has been to store the tape on a
# single reel, but to use a pair of reels (the media reel and a "take-up"
# reel) during operation.  The equipment used to record and play back
# magnetic media of this type is known as a "reel-to-reel deck", or sometimes
# as an "open reel" system; this terminology is not used with direct optical
# analog films, such as traditional motion picture films, the playback device
# is instead simply called a "projector".  Nonetheless, the mechanisms are
# similar: the take-up reel is powered, and pulls the tape forward, the
# supply reel may also be powered, to reduce tape tension, and a number of
# capstans, pinch rollers, frequently also powered, ensure uniform tape
# tension and speed across the heads.
#
# Tape cassettes enclose the reel(s) inside of a plastic shell; this speeds
# all operations except physical editing (splicing).  See Cassette.rb for
# details, and use that class for purposes where the reel(s) are not used
# directly.
