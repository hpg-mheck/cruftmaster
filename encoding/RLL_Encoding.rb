# RLL
# ---
# Run-Length Limited, a scheme for encoding data on hard disks and floppy
# diskettes.  See also "MFM", because there's some "chicken-and-egg"
# terminology history here.
#
# With respect to hard disk drives specifcally, "MFM controllers" pre-date
# the higher-density "RLL controllers", though strictly speaking, they all
# use run-length limited encoding schemes.  For details, please see:
