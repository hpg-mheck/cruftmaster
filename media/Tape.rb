# Tape
# ----
# This is a base class for any storage media consisting of a data storage
# layer on top of, or integrated with, a flexible substrate, whose length
# several orders of magnitude greater than its width, and which is therefore
# typically wound on reels.
#
# Tapes have common handling and storage requirements, distinct performance
# characteristics, and, perhaps most importantly, common failure modes,
# regardless of whether they are magnetic, optical, or paper.
