# This class is a mixin that provides a drive or media type with utility
# methods appropriate for solid state storage-- that is, a purely electronic
# device with no moving parts.  Using them on a per-device-type (and,
# potentially, per-model) basis ensures that a fault will be triggered if an
# inappropriate technique is used on storage where it makes no sense.
